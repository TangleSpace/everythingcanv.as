## Everything Canvas

Paint with the Everything 3d mesh library. 

### Running Locally  
`npm install` then `npm start` or you can just use something like mamp for testing. The built files just run on a basic apache server.  
`npm run build` to output minimized js file. I'm just using VS Codes minify plugin to autogenerate minified html and css files.  

have fun :-]
